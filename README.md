**SHAPE CLASS PROGRAM**

This program is written in Java and provides the calculation of perimeter and area for different shapes.

**CLASSES**

The program contains the following classes:

MAIN CLASS
This is the entry point for the program. It contains the main method, which creates objects of different shapes, adds them to an array, and then calculates their perimeter and area using their respective methods.

SHAPE CLASS
This is an abstract class that provides the common functionality for all shapes. It contains abstract methods for calculating perimeter and area, which are implemented by the subclasses.

SQUARE CLASS
This class represents a square shape and extends the Shape class. It contains a constructor that takes a single parameter, which is the length of one side of the square.

CIRCLE CLASS
This class represents a circle shape and extends the Shape class. It contains a constructor that takes a single parameter, which is the radius of the circle.

ELLIPSE CLASS
This class represents an ellipse shape and extends the Shape class. It contains a constructor that takes two parameters, which are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse.

RECTANGLE CLASS
This class represents a rectangle shape and extends the Shape class. It contains a constructor that takes two parameters, which are the lengths of the two adjacent sides of the rectangle.

**How to Run the Program**

To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can follow these steps:

Download the Java file containing the program code.
